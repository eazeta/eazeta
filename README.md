# **Emmanuel Zeta**

### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Emmanuel. I currently work as a Technical Business Analyst in Web Development. Myself and my team of devs utilise web development technologies to develop and maintain websites for Insurance companies.

Although I have a background in Web Development, I have a personal interest in data science.

I recently acheived a **First Class (Hons)** in **BSc Physics** at the University of Nottingham and I'm looking to delve deep into the tech scene!
